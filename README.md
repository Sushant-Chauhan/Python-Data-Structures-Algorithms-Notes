# Python Data Structures & Algorithms Notes
Welcome to my repository! This contains a collection of well-structured notes on Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. The notes are organized by topic and were created during my preparation for coding interviews and competitive programming challenges.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
The notes are divided into various sections based on different data structures and algorithms concepts. Each section includes explanations, example code snippets, and solutions to commonly asked problems in coding interviews.

Topics Covered:
Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks & Queues
Trees
Graphs
Sorting Algorithms
Dynamic Programming
Recursion
Hashing
Greedy Algorithms
Searching Algorithms
